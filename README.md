ðŸ§  Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables

Smart Sorting is an AI-powered system designed to detect and classify rotten fruits and vegetables using transfer learning with the VGG16 model. It helps automate quality checks in food processing, retail, and even smart homes to reduce food waste and enhance safety.

ðŸ‘‰ Project Workflow :
1. Dataset Collection (from Kaggle - 28 classes)
2. Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
3. Split into Training & Testing
4. Load & Fine-tune VGG16
5. Train, Evaluate, Save (.h5)
6. Build Flask App + UI
7. Deploy Locally
